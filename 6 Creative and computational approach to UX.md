Two POV on usability:
1. Quantitative: Values of usability metrics
2. Qualitative: usability problems

Применяется на этапе оценки.

Пример для calculative approach:
создать клавиатуру, на которой оптимально печатать

Пример для creative approach:
создать date picker одинаково удобный для людей, родившихся до 1980 и после 1980.

### Creative approach
There are two kinds of thinking:
1. Divergent thinking — about coming up with different answers to one stimulus (a stimulus is a question or a problem). *Out of the box thinking, creative*
2. Convergent thinking — is used when solving a test problem. Need to choose the best answer from existing based on facts and data.

**These two types of thinking cannot work at the same time**

#### What can we do to be more creative?
1. Sleep well
2. Positive mood
3. Use of external memory — short-term memory is limited, so each new idea should be documented on a paper or a whiteboard to free space for other ideas.
4. Association exercise, brainwriting

#### Creativity tools
1. "Steal like an artist": look for inspiration: competitors, analogous apps, any apps...
2. Reframing — changed constraint (e.g. context of use, time and resources,  chosen type of UI, technical capabilities of the chosen platform, technology that you are going to use to implement the app, etc.)
3. Brainstorming — Quantity over quality. Any ideas are allowed. Divide generation and evaluation time. Better to base ideas upon others' ideas. 12 is an optimal number of people.
4. Crowdsourcing — used for small tasks.

Quality of alternatives exploration — number of alternatives and how much they differ.

### Selection of solutions
Consists of two steps:
1. Preliminary selection (mindset)
	1. Run lightweight usability evaluation to discover interaction problems (scenario-based walkthroughs) for each alternative design
	2. Compare the designs according to usability goals specified earlier
2. Empirical evaluation

### Design rationale
1. Describe the use of the most promising alternatives in different contexts
2. Compare alternatives against the criteria
3. Justify the content of the rationale by theory (Fitts law) or by empirical data
4. Describe all relevant constraints


### Types of design representation
* Sketch — quick representation of an idea
* Wireframe — (компоновка) layout without visual style
* Mockup — detailed representation of UI appearance
* Garrett diagram — principal navigational structure
* UI-flow (переходы между экранами)
* Concept map — representation of domain entities and their relations (понять, какие сущности есть  с точки зрения пользователя. Используется, когда создаётся что-то сложное, *например, банковское приложение*)

### Computational approach
1. Space of combinatorial combinations (?)
2. 
3. Optimization formula
