4 steps:
1) Why? - understanding the problem
2) Modelling users
3) What? - setting the vision
4) How? - designing the product

*Evaluation is hidden in the last 2 phases*
Usually process is not linear, but feedback-driven. Potential user groups will evaluate the product and the next steps will be based on that. E.g. *it feels that the problem was not well understood and users don't care about it.*

Features:
* Design as a product definition â€” combines business needs with user needs taking into account technology limitations.
* Designers as researchers
* A process between research and design

### Modelling users
Using a [[4 Design informing models#Personas|persona]] 

### Setting the vision (What?)
1) Define the problem 
2) Ideate - the more, the better. Come up with solutions that invoke experiences described in the problem statement
3) Write context scenarios - serve as a guide when designing on the "How?" level. Use ideas from second step and [[4 Design informing models#Personas|personas]], and contexts. *Storyboard* is a substitute. These carry not all possible interactions with an application, but the most important ones to personas.
4) Identify requirements - can be derived from context scenarios. Also brand, experience and business requirements should be taken into consideration.


**When designing on the "How?" level, Product KPI's must be taken into account.**

### Inputs and outputs of the how level
Inputs:
From the research phase:
* Design-informing models
* Design ideas and best practices from competing products
From the vision phase:
* Context scenarios
* Requirements
* Product KPIs

Outputs:
* Mockups
* Graphic assets
* Design specifications
