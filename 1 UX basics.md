### Mark Hassenzahl's model
(Хассензаль)
Model of each product. Has 3 levels:
1) Why? - for what this thing exists. The user must have a goal when interacting with a product | *game is used for fun*
2) What? - what a person can do through the product | *in tetris a person can stack tetrominos in a cup to eliminate full rows*
3) How? - the way user interact with a product | *user presses console keys to move and rotate tetrominos*


Emotions that arise during interaction are called <span style="color:yellow;">immediate moment-by-moment experience</span>

On the other hand, <span style="color:yellow;">[User] experience</span> — a chunk of time that one went through. Sights and sounds, feelings and thoughts closely knitted together, stored in a memory, labelled, relieved and communicated to others. An experience is a story. It is subjective, holistic (total, related to the whole), situated, dynamic

### Disciplines of Hassenzahl's model
Why? & What?
* UX (user experience) design
* Product design
* Service design
* + Game design
How?
* Interaction design — Is concerned with creation of **complex interactive (user actions have a feedback, the artefact changes its state, unlike to a physical object, say, hammer) artefacts**.
* Informational architecture — concerned with informational positioning
* Visual design
* Motion design
* Sound design

### UI (User interface)
a bunch of controls. (*all components of an interactive system, software or hardware that provide information and controls for the user to accomplish specific tasks with the interactive system*)

### Interaction design
is design for human use. It is dangerous to view it as a UI, because it's more than that. We should consider what a person is thinking, doing and feeling while interacting with an app.

Goal is: to make given functionality accessible  in an esthetically pleasing way. We imagine an ideal interaction and design UI with accordance with this ideal interaction.
