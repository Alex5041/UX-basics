### Contextual usability
*Usability is a "hygiene factor" meaning that users don't notice it when its there and immediately notice that it is not there. Usability does not makes users happy, it prevents them from being frustrated by removing obstacles on the user's paths to getting what they want*.

<span style="color:yellow;">Usability</span> (ISO standard) — extent to which system, product or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with *effectiveness*, *efficiency* and *satisfaction* in a **specified context of use**.

1) <span style="color:yellow;">Effectiveness</span> — accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals. (achieving user's goals AND absence of negative consequences during goal achievement).
		Metrics:
		* Percentage of tasks completed successfully on first attempt
		* Number of uncorrected errors
		* Rating scale for task success
2) <span style="color:yellow;">Efficiency</span> — resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals.
		Metrics:
		* **Time on task**
		* Time on correcting errors
		* Rating scale for user performance
3) <span style="color:yellow;">Satisfaction</span> — freedom from discomfort, and positive attitudes toward use of the product.
		Metrics:
		* Rating scale for ease of use
		* Amount (level) of negative emotions
		* Rating scale for overall satisfaction


*Subjective user's evaluation (3rd metric for every part) of such three parameters is no less important than objective metrics*

<span style="color:yellow;">Context of use</span> — any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application including the user and the application themselves. *Is not a bunch of entities and their attributes*. Entities influence the interaction in the moment and this should be taking into consideration.

**Overcoming barriers (anything that impedes user activity, interrupts workflow or communications, or interferes with the performance of work responsibilities) is a way to satisfy users — "removing obstacles from their paths"**.

Each user goal consists of tasks. Each <span style="color:yellow;">task</span> is activities undertaken to reach a goal.
