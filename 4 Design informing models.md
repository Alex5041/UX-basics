### Design-informing models
are not building blocks that appear directly in the design but are artifacts that embody, drive, inform, and inspire the design. They are design-oriented constructs such as task descriptions or user personas, that turn raw data into actionable items as design ideas, as elements to consider or take into account in the design.

There are many types of such models each of which can be used for different purposes:
1) reaching a consensus among team members on a particular feature of the [[2 Context of use|usage context]]
2) helping to decide what problems  should be addressed
3) serve as a design tool

*I only need to create the models which will help me to efficiently achieve my purposes*

### Personas
Persona - a composite user archetype that represents distinct group of behaviors, attitudes, motives and goals based on user research.

### BPMNs
Business process model â€” how business works. *For example, how an order is carried in McDonalds, what are the steps, who is involved.*

### User journey map
For "What level". Similar to the BPMN that describes the activities, however considers only one user's group point of view and at a higher level. **It describes user moving between touch points which represent user interaction with a service in a particular channel**. Touch points cover a small part of activities.

*Extremely popular in service design*. Allows a bird eye view look and helps locating problems in moving from one point to another rather than within them.

### HTA
Hierarchical task analysis. In case below, describes how we want people to act.
